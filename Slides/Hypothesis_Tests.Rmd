## Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

## Difference of means

The `mtcars` dataset contains information about 32 cars.

Suppose we want to know if automatic and manual cars have the same miles per gallon.

--

```{r}

mtcars %>%
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarize(mean(mpg))

```


---
## Difference of Means

Of course, the 32 car models in this dataset are **not** all the
cars in the world.  

--

So the **true difference of means** between is probably not *exactly* 24.4-17.1 = 7.3.

--

But do we have **evidence** that the difference in means is **not zero**?

---
## Two-sample t-test

```{r}
my_test <- mtcars %>%
  t_test(response = mpg,
         explanatory = am)

my_test
```

Based on **this sample**, we have **strong evidence** that the mpg is different.

---
## Two-sample t-test

```{r}
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
```

---
## Two-sample t-test

```{r}
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars) %>%
  tidy()
```


---
## Significance vs effect size


In English, "significant" means **important** or **big**.

--

In French, "*significant*" means **signifying** or **indicative**.

--

**Statistical Significance** comes from the French version.

---
## Significance vs effect size


The **effect size** can be large but **insignificant**.

--


> You sample 3 people from California and 3 people from New York.  You find a difference in average annual salaries of $500,000.  Does this *signify* that CA and NY have different salaries overall?

--

The **effect size** can be small but **significant**.

--

> You sample 1000 people from California and 1000 people from New York.  You find a difference in average annual salaries of $10.  Does this *signify* that CA and NY have different salaries overall?

---
## Reporting results

We need to report both the effect size **and** the significance.

--

> We observe that on average, manual cars have 7.3 more miles per gallon than automatic cars.

> With a p-value of 0.001, we reject the null hypothesis that mpgs is equal.  We have strong evidence that manual cars have more mpg on average.

## The t distribution

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +  
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "pink", color = "black")+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean(mtcars$mpg), sd = sd(mtcars$mpg)),
                color = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 1.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 65)) +
  theme_bw()
```

class: center, middle, inverse
# The Central Limit Theorem!

--

## The *sample mean* is approximately Normal (t)

## As long as it's a mean of many (say > 15) samples.

## Transmission and gears

Now consider the question:  Do automatic and manual cars tend to have different types of engines?

--

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  count(am, cyl)
```

---

## Transmission and gears

We **could** do a t-test of "average cylinders" - but this doesn't really make sense; these are *categories* of engine types.

--

Instead: **chi-square tests**

--

Null hypothesis:  There is **no relationship** between transmission type and engine type.

--

Alternate hypothesis:  There **is a relationship**.

---

## Transmission and gears

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  janitor::tabyl(am, cyl)
```

---

## Transmission and gears

```{r}
library(janitor)

mtcars %>%
  tabyl(am, cyl) %>%
  adorn_percentages()
```

---

## Transmission and gears

What happens if you swap the order of the variables?

--

```{r}

mtcars %>%
  tabyl(cyl, am) %>%
  adorn_percentages()
```

---
## Transmission and gears

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>%
  chisq_test(am ~ cyl)
```
---

## Transmission and gears


```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    am = factor(am),
    cyl = factor(cyl)
  ) %>%
  chisq_test(am ~ cyl)
```

---

## Transmission and gears

What happens if you switch the order of the variables?

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    am = factor(am),
    cyl = factor(cyl)
  ) %>%
  chisq_test(cyl ~ am)
```

---
## Conclusion

We have **evidence** that there is a relationship between transmission type and engine type.

--

Manual cars tend to have more 4-cylinder engines, while automatic cars tend to have more 8-cylinder engines

---
## Word of Caution

Do automatic cars and manual cars tend to have a different number of gears?

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  tabyl(am, gear) %>%
  adorn_percentages()
```

---
## Word of Caution

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    am = factor(am),
    gear = factor(gear)
  ) %>%
  chisq_test(gear ~ am)
```

---
## Word of Caution

```{r, error = TRUE}
mtcars %>%
  tabyl(am, gear) %>%
  fisher.test()
```

# Your Turn

* Do automatic cars and manual cars tend to have different horsepower?

* Do automatic cars and manual cars tend to have a different shape of engine?  (Hint: `?mtcars` for more info about the dataset.)
